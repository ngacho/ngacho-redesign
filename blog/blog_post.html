                    Because the Iraq war is not just a security problem, it's a moral problem. But we cannot walk away
                    this
                    time. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in
                    jeopardy,
                    ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found
                    the
                    courage to keep it alive. America, we cannot turn back. That is the responsibility we have to one
                    another as human beings.</br></br>

                    Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory
                    terms,
                    or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect. And occasionally it
                    finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. John McCain likes to say
                    that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
                    </br></br>

                    Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money
                    wasted, by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. They all have different stories and reasons.
                    </br></br>

                    Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban with broad international
                    support. We will help Iraq train its Security Forces and develop its economy. This is important
                    because
                    no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained
                    while young people are out of work.
                    </br></br>

                    Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you
                    have
                    heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. So let there
                    be
                    no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable.
                    </br></br>

                    They know those things. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking
                    on a
                    program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change. This time we want to reject the
                    cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are
                    somebody
                    else's problem. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and
                    Afghanistan, I
                    see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by
                    a
                    grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. Let me also address the issue of
                    Iraq.
                    For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is indeed
                    a
                    tumultuous history between us.
                    </br></br>

                    I thought of the families I've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income,
                    or
                    whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked
                    long-term
                    health benefits because they were Reservists. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend
                    Wright
                    made in his offending sermons about America - to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to
                    the
                    point that it distorts reality. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. I reject the
                    view
                    of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do
                    believe
                    that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality.
                    </br></br>

                    This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look
                    like
                    you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing
                    more
                    than a profit. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a
                    simple concept: E pluribus unum: "Out of many, one." This bond is unbreakable.
                    </br></br>

                    "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the
                    reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard something else; at
                    the
                    foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of
                    ordinary
                    black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the
                    lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, we have
                    seen
                    Muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead.
                    </br></br>

                    I didn't fall out in church, as folks sometimes do. I can no more disown him than I can disown the
                    black
                    community. It is where our union grows stronger. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility
                    -
                    that's the essence of America's promise. I know there is debate about this issue.
                    </br></br>

                    I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me, a woman who
                    sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world,
                    but
                    a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more
                    than
                    one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. For while Senator McCain
                    was
                    turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it
                    would
                    distract us from the real threats we face. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. So I've
                    got
                    news for you, John McCain. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the
                    number
                    of unwanted pregnancies in this country. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who
                    said:
                    "I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the
                    greater it will be."
                    </br></br>

                    And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective
                    conscience.
                    Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have responsibilities.
                    </br></br>

                    I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations.
                    She
                    knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what
                    she
                    really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches. But
                    if
                    we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only
                    resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and
                    Palestinians each live in peace and security.
                    </br></br>

                    That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. With profound gratitude and great
                    humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. We cannot walk alone.
                    And I
                    consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative
                    stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
                    </br></br>

                    Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. God is still
                    speaking. And right here in the UCC, we're hearing from God about what it means to be a welcoming
                    church
                    that holds on to our Christian witness. They endure the daily humiliations - large and small - that
                    come
                    with occupation.
                    </br></br>

                    Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.
