And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews.

This is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work.</br></br>Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. So let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. </br></br>They know those things. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change. This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. Let me also address the issue of Iraq. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is indeed a tumultuous history between us. </br></br>I thought of the families I've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America - to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. </br></br> This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum: <q>Out of many, one.</q> This bond is unbreakable. </br></br> People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, we have seen Muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead. </br></br> I didn't fall out in church, as folks sometimes do. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. It is where our union grows stronger. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility-that's the essence of America's promise. I know there is debate about this issue.</br></br>I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. So I've got news for you, John McCain. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: <q>I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.<q></br></br> And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have responsibilities. </br></br> I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.</br></br> That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. We cannot walk alone. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.</br></br> Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. God is still speaking. And right here in the UCC, we're hearing from God about what it means to be a welcoming church that holds on to our Christian witness. They endure the daily humiliations - large and small - that come with occupation.</br></br>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</br></br>"

I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. It is where our union grows stronger. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility-that's the essence of America's promise. I know there is debate about this issue.</br></br>I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. So I've got news for you, John McCain. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: <q>I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.<q></br></br> And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have responsibilities. </br></br> I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.</br></br> That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. We cannot walk alone. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.</br></br> Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. God is still speaking. And right here in the UCC, we're hearing from God about what it means to be a welcoming church that holds on to our Christian witness. They endure the daily humiliations - large and small - that come with occupation.</br></br>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</br></br>"
